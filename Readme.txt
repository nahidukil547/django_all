# 🔑 Purpose of the Authentication System in Django

The **Django authentication system** is designed to answer two key questions in a secure and structured way:

- 👤 **Who are you?** (Authentication)  
- 🔐 **What are you allowed to do?** (Authorization)  

---

## 📌 Why We Need It
When building applications like **e-commerce**, **student management systems**, or **blogs**, we need to:  

✅ Identify users (login, signup)  
✅ Verify users (check password, email, tokens)  
✅ Control access (normal user vs. staff vs. admin)  
✅ Manage sessions (keep a user logged in until logout)  

Django provides all of these features out of the box, so developers don’t have to reinvent the wheel.

## 🎯 Main Features

### 1. 👤 User Authentication (Identify user)
- Verifies if the user is who they claim to be.  
- Example: Login with username/email + password → validated using Django auth backends.  

---

### 2. 🔐 User Authorization (Define permissions)
- Determines what actions an authenticated user can perform.  
- Example: `is_staff` can access the admin panel, normal user cannot.  

---

### 3. 🗂 Session Management
- Keeps users logged in across multiple requests (via cookies + session ID).  
- Example: No need to login again after every page reload.  

---

### 4. 🔒 Password & Security Handling
- Stores passwords in **hashed + salted** format (never plain text).  
- Supports secure password change, reset, and recovery.  

---

### 5. ⚙️ Pluggable Backends
- Use default (username/password) or create custom (email login, phone OTP, JWT, etc.).  

---

### 6. 🛠 Integration with Django Admin
- Powers the Django Admin interface.  
- Manage users, groups, and permissions easily.  

---

## 🚀 Why It’s Important
- Saves development time with secure, ready-to-use components.  
- Follows best practices (password hashing, CSRF, session security).  
- Flexible and extendable (supports custom backends).  
- Critical for **any production-ready project**.
